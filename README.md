- A Project must start with a user requirement session
- The requirement must be translated into a design to be disscussed and agreed upon by project tim and owner
- Implementaton of a a design into coding must be carried out in collaboratory manner
- A series of Testing and revision (STLC) must be excercised consistently involving owner based on an initial prototype
- A Quality Control mechanism must be inplace involving owner to ensure application is in line with initial agreed requirements and design 
- Deployment  & delivery must be made official to signal the end of the application lifecyle
